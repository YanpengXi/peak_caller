## peak_caller

This program was written to simplify the quality control, mapping, and peak calling of next-genereation sequencing result. One can have a quick overview of data behavior in this way, so that following time-consuming analysis could be designed more efficiently.


Fcuntions:
- read in input fastq file
- check average quality of all reads
- trim left and right border of reads to generated satisfied quality range
- map trimmed reads back to reference genome
- call peak based on given threshold and distribution width
